#### PackageMaker is an amazing tool created by Apple, which still works today in macOS Mojave, it was introduced in Mac OS X Panther 10.3 Several versions have been released and the last one was V- 3.0.6 (201)
- For my part I use it regularly to create all kinds of packages as well as MetaPackages. I have several projects that include programs created by PackageMaker.
 - I've never really understood why Apple remove it and give up are developement?

  <summary>How to use PackageMaker for Mac </summary>

It’s a very neat tool for systems administrators to use and create packages for OS X.

PackageMaker let’s you create simple and easy to use application or script packages to be deployed on clients machines.
Personally, I use PackageMaker constantly to create deployment software for batch installs or even pass on customized softwares to my end users as a simple to use install.


Once you have it install, launch it

![Modular Image Creation](https://i25.servimg.com/u/f25/18/50/18/69/packag11.png)


In the Organization Field, you need a unique Organization concept such as com.apple, com.google (Clearly you don’t want to use those but pick something according)
Click OK

![Modular Image Creation](https://i25.servimg.com/u/f25/18/50/18/69/packag12.png)


At this stage, you will need to give the package a title
Select the Install Destination (User selected, System Drive i.e Macintosh HD or the user home folder)
You can add a certificate (I will not get into that, because apps tied to certs are actual in house apps and chances are you rather the software checked in rather than having the cert with it)
Description will just give a written explanation to the user


![Modular Image Creation](https://i25.servimg.com/u/f25/18/50/18/69/packag13.png)


Drag and Drop the app or Files you want to include in your package over to the content section (Firefox in this case)
You will see the permissions options allowing you to set permissions for the files.
Unless you know what you are doing, just apply the recommendations.

![Modular Image Creation](https://i25.servimg.com/u/f25/18/50/18/69/packag14.png)


The configuration tab will allow you to say where exactly the app should be stored, give it an identifier and a version to your package, you can also set if it needs admin authentication or a restart action

![Modular Image Creation](https://i25.servimg.com/u/f25/18/50/18/69/interf10.png)


The Blue Interface Logo above the packageMaker window will allow you to customize the interface for a better User Experience.
This would be where you would put the User Agreement, etc.
Once all is done.
Click the Build and you will be prompted for a Saved Location and File Name
That’s it, you have created your package and it’s ready to use.
I would also recommend you save the PackageMaker build File so if you needed to make a new version it would be easy.
